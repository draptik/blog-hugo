I can finally scratch 'attending the main SoCraTes unconference' from my bucket list.
What can I say - it was worth it!

Although I have visited several great SoCraTes partner events in the past, I've never had the chance to visit the main SoCraTes event in Soltau.
This year SoCraTes Soltau took place in **July** for the first time, giving me a chance to attend
(in the past the event was always scheduled in August, which is family vacation time for me).

So whats makes this event special?

### Really diverse

I don't go out much these days, so being exposed to many people enjoying different sexual and clothing choices was new to me.
And what shall I say: It was a pleasure talking to all those "different" (to me!) IT nerds.

There was a really strict Code-of-Conduct.
It took me a while to get used to it.

Jokes/Conversations about things like

- appearance (i.e. fat-shaming),
- drugs (i.e "your cocktail doesn't contain alcohol")
- religion
- or food (making fun of vegans, or people with food intolerance)

...where NOT tolerated.

This was enforced, but easy to follow.

And made **conversations always go into a positive direction.**
Being **tolerant and open-minded goes a long way.**
Even when talking about difficult topics such as politics.

Don't get me wrong:
All other SoCraTes partner events I have visited in the past also have enforced the same Code-of-Conduct,
but this event had close to 200 participants, so it was more obvious and necessary.

### My experience

The acronym SoCraTes stands for "Software Craft and Testing", so these topics where obvious.
Since there were 11 (!) parallel sessions happening at the same time there was a lot of
FOMO ("fear-of-missing-out") involved.
This FOMO feeling continued for 4 days.
And there where sessions until way past midnight...

I shared some knowledge by giving sessions on:

- [Property-Based Testing](https://draptik.github.io/2025-07-socrates-de-property-based-testing/)
- [Approval Testing](https://draptik.github.io/2025-07-socrates-de-approval-testing/)
- [Modern Linux CLI Tools](https://draptik.github.io/2025-07-socrates-de-modern-linux-cli-tools/)

I also visited many other sessions. Some of them where:

- Custom Keyboards
- Test Strategies with QA
- Teaching IT to school kids
- Hating POSIX - Having a look at NuShell

But the best session was obviously the hallway-track ðŸ˜Ž

Aside from a Pen-Testing evening session titled "Capture the flag".
This turned out to be my absolute highlight, because the presented test scenario using
[hackthebox.org](https://www.hackthebox.com/) closely resembled my own freshly setup home-server.
I visited the follow-up evening session on the next day as well.
If you get a chance to be introduced to Pen-Testing by [Lisi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisihocke/): Go for it!

During another evening chat I managed to get one of the smart organizers to fix my home DNS
setup when using WireGuard - took him less than 10min. How cool is that? (thanks [Raimo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rradczewski/))

On the last day I attended [Markus'](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-decke/)
Code-Retreat and learned some new constraints for this popular exercise. "Hey" ðŸ˜ƒ

My summary: If you have the opportunity to visit this great "un-conference": Go for it!

### Travel

Traveling to Soltau was challenging, because no matter if you traveled by car or train, there where many obstacles.
I was lucky enough to travel with [Chris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-welcz-823603274/)
so the 7 hour trip in each direction was very relaxed.
