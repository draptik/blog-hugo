[This post by Lynsay](http://www.lynsayshepherd.com/blog/?p=1340) describes in detail how to convert a non-network printer into a network printer.

You will have to install CUPS and SAMBA on your Raspberry Pi.

Once your done you can access the printer from any OS (windows, linux, mac) within your network.
